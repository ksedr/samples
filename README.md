Example coding tasks.

Note:
Example improvements for anomaly detection task:
- find and implement better algorithm for anomaly detection in text time series data, exploit n-gram dependencies
- add unit and integration tests
- add exception handling
- improve presentation of results
- implement additional methods for input text processing, e.g. stemming, filtering
